# Fenrir
A Breakout-style game project

Fenrir is a Breakout clone that is played with the mouse. Moving the mouse left or right moves the paddle. If the ball collides with the paddle, a brick, or any edge of the screen except the bottom, it bounces. If the ball goes off the bottom of the screen, it restarts at the center of the paddle.
